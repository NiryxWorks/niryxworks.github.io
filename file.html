  <h1>About Niryx</h1>
  <p>
    Niryx is a government-owned, classified operating unit. <strong>level IV-Σ</strong>, Established to ensure the continuity of strategic technological development in unconventional contexts. The organization operates under varying jurisdictions depending on the operating framework, with functional autonomy limited directly to the Intrastate Oversight Board.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a decentralized entity, Niryx coordinates critical infrastructure, unstructured information flows, and variable application technologies for undisclosed institutional objectives. Operations are executed under the 27/A Protocol framework, with post-implementation validation (retrospective mode) and authorization through structured referral.
  </p>

  <h2>General Structure</h2>
  <p>
    The organization operates through distributed cells, under a modular and compartmentalized model. Each cell answers only to its assigned Authority Level, with operational functions codified according to internal criteria. There is no cross-disclosure between units. Leadership remains under the direct direction of the Niryx Executive Office, which retains full authority over institutional policy, budget allocations, and validation of operational continuity.
  </p>

  <h2>Jurisdiction and Scope</h2>
  <p>
    Niryx Works' institutional areas of application are not subject to conventional geographic boundaries. The organization maintains multilateral agreements under extrapolated legal entities, and its scope of action is activated only under conditions stipulated in the Undocumented Cooperation Treaty (UCT).
  </p>

  <p>
    Any activity carried out by or for Niryx is considered outside the scope of ordinary civil or military law. Investigations, interventions, or implementations carried out are not recorded in public systems nor are they part of the visible administrative history.
  </p>

  <h2>Institutional Declaration</h2>
  <div class="notice">
